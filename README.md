# sailwave_sailing_competition_results
This Jupyter Notebook retrieves official sailing race results from a Sailwave HTML page and automatically generates a clean, static HTML report with consolidated classifications. 

The script:

Scrapes the original results tables directly from the event website (ILCA 4 and ILCA 6 competitions)

Preserves the original tables for reference

Computes individual rankings by division (age category), ordered by nett points

Computes collective rankings by yacht club

Highlights the top 3 positions in each ranking

Organizes all results into a single navigable HTML page with internal links

Separates ILCA 4 and ILCA 6 sections visually

Exports the final report as a standalone HTML file with an external CSS stylesheet

The output is a static, offline-ready HTML page suitable for publication, archiving, or sharing with clubs and athletes.
